# These groups are read by MariaDB server.
# Use it for options that only the server (but not clients) should see

# this is read by the standalone daemon and embedded servers

# this is only for the mysqld standalone daemon
[mysqld]

#
# * Basic Settings
#

#user                    = mysql
pid-file                = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
basedir                 = /usr
#datadir                 = /var/lib/mysql
#tmpdir                  = /tmp

# Broken reverse DNS slows down connections considerably and name resolve is
# safe to skip if there are no "host by domain name" access grants
#skip-name-resolve

# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.

# changed the bind-address to 0.0.0.0 so that MariaDB server accepts connections
# on all host IPv4 interfaces
bind-address            = 0.0.0.0

#
# * Fine Tuning
#

#key_buffer_size        = 128M
#max_allowed_packet     = 1G
#thread_stack           = 192K
#thread_cache_size      = 8
# This replaces the startup script and checks MyISAM tables if needed
# the first time they are touched
#myisam_recover_options = BACKUP
#max_connections        = 100
#table_cache            = 64

#
# * Logging and Replication
#

# Note: The configured log file or its directory need to be created
# and be writable by the mysql user, e.g.:
# $ sudo mkdir -m 2750 /var/log/mysql
# $ sudo chown mysql /var/log/mysql
